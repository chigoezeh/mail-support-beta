# mail-support-beta
This is a code I wrote around 2018 purposely for sending out emails directly to clients and prospects. After losing many of repos in a previous GitHub account, I thought it's cool to bring it up here. It's an unfinished project though, but you can actually build from it if you're a PHP lover.
